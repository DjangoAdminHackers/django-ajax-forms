# Introduction #
Additional options can be applied to your Django forms using a technique similar to adding a `Meta` class to your Django forms.

# Details #
We can control how Ajax rules are generated by adding a inner `Ajax` class.
Below is a simple example of a password change form that includes rules that are applied at a Form level rather than to each field specifically. This is typically used to duplicate the functionality of any _clean_ methods that may be present within your class (note: this class would normally contain a _clean_ method to do a server side check to ensure both password fields match):
```
class Foo(forms.Form):

    old_password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput(render_value=False))
    password1 = forms.CharField(label='New Password', min_length=6, widget=forms.PasswordInput(render_value=False),
        help_text = "at least 6 characters (case sensitive)")
    password2 = forms.CharField(label='New Password (again)', required=False, widget=forms.PasswordInput(render_value=False))

    class Ajax:
        rules = [
            ('password2', {'equal_to_field': 'password1'})
        ]
        messages = [
            ('password2', {'equal_to_field': "Password fields didn't match."})
        ]
```
In the above example an additional rule is being applied to _password2_ to check that it's value is the same as the value of the field _password1_. An error message is also supplied.

See the [JSONFieldReference](JSONFieldReference.md) wiki page for a complete list of available fields and associated messages.
